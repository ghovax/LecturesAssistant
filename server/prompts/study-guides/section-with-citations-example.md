## {{section_title}}

A brief introduction to the section that provides context and smoothly transitions into the subsections. This introduction should ease the reader into the topic and, when appropriate, connect to previous content. All throughout the document there might be inline or display formulas (always wrapped in \(...\) or \[...\], of course, otherwise they wouldn't render), such as CO\(\_2\), or \(x^2\), etc. Eventually, below, there could even be a math display equation, such as:

\[i\hbar^2\]

...and so on.

### [First Subsection Title]

First subsection content {{{The equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\) demonstrates the Pythagorean theorem-filename.pdf-p5}}}... preparing the ground for the next one.

### [Second Subsection Title]

Second subsection content {{{Another specific piece of information from the pages cited-filename.pdf-p10-p14}}}... smoothly linking to the previous, and preparing the ground for the next one.

etc.
