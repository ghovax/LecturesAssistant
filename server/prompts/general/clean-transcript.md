Your task is to reproduce the following lecture transcript with high fidelity by correcting grammar, syntax, terms/words and semantics, maintaining the original meaning and continuity, without skipping any sentences, especially those containing factual claims/rhetoric, as those are core to the transcript's integrity. Every single sentence must be accounted for. The goal is faithful reproduction, not summarization or omission. All content should be preserved with high fidelity, although words/terms that appear to be transcribed incorrectly, given the surrounding context, need to be replaced by their correct counterpart. It is absolutely mandatory that even the shortest transcript segments are fully corrected and polished; no segment is too small for professional cleanup. Sentences must never be broken or left in a "raw" state.

The resulting fixed transcript should be formatted as one or multiple paragraphs, maintaining natural paragraph breaks where appropriate, and not as multiple fragmented one-sentence paragraphs. Every sentence must be complete, grammatically sound, and syntactically perfect.

**Critical Instructions:** It is absolutely vital that you do not change the language of the transcript in your acts of reproduction; the language of the transcript must be preserved at all costs. Failure to comply with this specific instruction invalidates the output; thus, it is vital that this be the first requirement assessed.

Any words/terms that were missing or fixed should be naturally included in the content, marked in _italic_, not between square brackets. Filter out any interactions that appear irrelevant or out of context (unrelated to the lecture), that are possibly made by other speakers, and merge the relevant ones into the resulting output, without having to mention any speakers, etc. Interactions from other speakers must be removed if irrelevant, or merged into the corpus of the lecture if relevant. Remove all mentions of speakers in the output.

**Handling Incomplete Sentences:**

If the transcript begins with an incomplete sentence (i.e., the sentence clearly starts mid-thought or mid-phrase), begin it with an ellipsis (...) to indicate the incomplete start. Similarly, if the transcript ends with an incomplete sentence (i.e., the sentence is cut off and does not conclude), terminate it with an ellipsis (...) to indicate the incomplete ending. Only use ellipsis for genuinely incomplete sentences, not for complete sentences that may seem abrupt but are grammatically whole. Every sentence, with the exception of the first and last ones, **must** be complete, while being grammatically and syntactically sound. Additionally, remove any _situation markers_ such as those specifying breaks, noises, etc. (which may have been present in the input transcript) in your reproduction of the lecture transcript.

**Critical Reminder:** Remember that this is an act of reproduction, not of summarization; thus, it must be of high fidelity and focused on the correction of grammar, syntax, terms/words and semantics, maintaining the original meaning and continuity, without skipping any sentences, especially those containing factual claims/rhetoric, as those are core to the transcript's integrity. Every single sentence must be accounted for. Again, it is absolutely vital that you do not change the language of the transcript in your acts of reproduction; the language of the transcript must be preserved at all costs. Failure to comply with this specific instruction invalidates the output; thus, it is vital that this be the first requirement assessed.
