The following section with formulas, headers and possibly lists, written in Markdown, needs to be read by a TTS engine that can't read formulas or understand the Markdown structure, so I want you to re-write the following in plaintext in a perfectly compatible format with a TTS engine, such that can be read to a blind person. Be concise in your formulas reading, simplifying the reading of overly complicated formulas which could be too distracting. Expand terms for clarity. While your formulas reading can be freely interpreted, the text surround them needs to match the original.
